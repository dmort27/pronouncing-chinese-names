# Pronouning Chinese Names

One way of welcoming students and colleagues is striving to say their names in a way that is familiar and recognizable to them. This is hard, since different languages have different sounds and different conventions for representing these sounds. But a little effort can go a long way.

Many of our students and colleagues have Chinese names. The names of individuals who have connections to mainland China are often represented in Latin characters using a system called Pinyin (students from Taiwan often romanize their names using a different system, called Wade-Giles). Pinyin in completely consistent and can represent all of the sounds of Chinese, but the way letters are pronounced differs significantly from how they are pronounced in English or other European languages.

The purpose of this document is to give English equivalents of Pinyin letters and letter sequences. Because of the sound-structure of Chinese, it is useful to talk about this in terms of onsets (the consonants at the beginning of a syllable) and rhymes (the vowels and any consonants that come after them in a syllable).

The equivalents are approximate, but they can help you show that you are trying.

## Onsets

For many of the onset consonants, you can pronounce them just as you would in English:

m, n, p, t, k, b, d, g, f, s, h, l, r, w, and y

The other consonants differ from the English consonants in their pronunciation. The following table gives the details:

The same items, organized according to how and where in the mouth the sounds are produced, are given in the following table:

| Pinyin | English | Example | Notes                   |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------------------|
| m      | m       | mad     |                         |

| y      | y       | yam     |                         |

## Rhymes

As in other languages, words in Chinese can be divided into syllables. In the middle of each syllable are one or more vowels. They can optionally be followed by either *n* or *ng*. The vowels and the final *n* or *ng* are called the rhyme.

In rhymes, the way letters are pronounced varies according to context, but in a perfectly predictable way.

### Simple vowels

The simple vowels have the hardest patterns. Learn these first.

| Pinyin | English | Example | Notes                                    | Example Names      |
|--------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| a      | a       | ah, cat | between the vowel in *ah* and *cat*      | *Ma* ma            |
| e      | u       | cut     |                                          | *He* huh           |
| i      | z       | bzzz    | when following *c*, *z*, or *s*          | *Ziyi* dzzzyee     |
| i      | r       | brrr    | when following *ch*, *zh*, *sh*, or *r*  | *Zhisong* jrrrsong |
| i      | ee      | see     |                                          | *Yijie* yeejyeah   |
| o      | wo      | wore    |                                          | *Bohan* bwohan     |
| u      | oo      | mood    |                                          | *Zhu* juu          | 

### Vowels followed by -n or -ng

The vowel + nasal rhymes are relatively straightforward:

| Pinyin | English | Example | Notes                             | Example Names      |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| an     | an      | GAN     | vowel between *ah* and *cat*      | *An* Ann~ahn       |
| en     | un      | bun     |                                   | *Wenhe* won-huh    |
| ang    | ong     | long    | vowel between *ah* and *cat*      | *Wang* wong        |
| eng    | ung     | lung    |                                   | *Pengfei* pungfay  |
| in     | in      | in      |                                   | *Xinyu* sheenyoo   |
| ing    | ing     | sing    |                                   | *Xingyu* sheengyoo |
| ong    | one     | phone   | vowel in *phone* followed by *ng* | *Dong* doang       |
| un     | won     | won     |                                   | *Junjie* jwonjeea  |

### Diphthongs and triphthongs

We can think of diphthongs as vowel sounds that are written as two letters and triphthongs as vowel sounds that are written with three levels. Once you know these, you know most of what you need to pronounce Chinese names.

| Pinyin | English | Example | Notes                             | Example Names            |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| ai     | i       | like    |                                   | *Haiwen* high-won        |
| ao     | ow      | how     |                                   | *Haobo* how-bwo          |
| ei     | ay      | hay     |                                   | *Weiqi* waychee          |
| ie     | yeah    | yeah    |                                   | *Shengjie* shung-jeea    |
| iao    | yao     | Yao     |                                   | *Miao* myao              |
| iu     | yo      | yo      |                                   | *Yangqiu* yong-chyo      |
| ou     | o       | hope    |                                   | *Hou* hoe                |
| ua     | wa      | watt    | vowel between *ah* and *cat*      | *Hua* hwah               |
| ui     | way     | way     |                                   | *Bohui* bwohway          |
| uo     | wo      | wore    |                                   | *Guo* gwo                |
| uai    | why     | why     |                                   | *Shuaidong* sh-why-doang |

### Diphthongs and triphthongs followed by -n or -ng

These follow the same patterns as the other rhymes but it is hard to find English equivalents for some of them:

| Pinyin | English | Example | Notes                                | Example Names   |
|--------|---------|---------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| ian    | yen     | yen     |                                      | *Tian* tee-uhn  |
| iang   | yang    |         | vowel between *ah* and *cat*         | *Liang* lee-ong |
| iong   | yong    |         | vowel as in *oh*                     | *Xiong* shyoang |
| uan    | wan     | wan     | vowel between *ah* and *cat*         | *Duan* dwan     |
| uang   | wong    | Wong    | as in American English pronunciation | *Huang* Hwong   |
| ueng   | wuhng   | won     | final consonant as in *song*         | (very rare)     |
