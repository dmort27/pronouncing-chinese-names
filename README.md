# pronouncing-chinese-names
A pronunciation guide for Chinese names intended for speakers of American English

This guide is intended to help speakers of English pronounce Chinese names as faithfully as possible, within the constraints of English phonology (the English sound system).
Its goals are broadly like those of [David Chiang's “Pronouncing Chinese in English”](https://github.com/davidweichiang/pronunciation/blob/634787c0d83f2e33a93792f9bbd136660f7dabac/pinyin.md). It differs in that, rather than trying to present Chinese names as they are pronounced by English-Chinese bilinguals, it is meant to help English speakers approximate the native Chinese pronunciation.
